# Environmental Measure Forecasting Application

This application allows for forecasting different environmental measures using different models, ARIMA and LSTM. Choose which model works best for you!

This is a final project for Times Series Analysis at Indiana University. The Front-end, Back-end, data processing, data cleaning, and ARIMA model was done by [Collin Kovacs](https://github.com/cjk5642). The LSTM model development, tuning and training was done by Pankaj Singh. The creation of the project and research of the projects was done by Matthew Yeseta.
